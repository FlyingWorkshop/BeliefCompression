Strategy: Get the fastest MVP possible

# Paper
For paper, only plan to include a couple of exponential families. You can write out the full derivation based from $G$.

Include:
* Poisson
* Normal
* Bernoulli
* (additional) geometric (what is the use-case?)

# Style
Try to emulate PCA from python style for first draft

# TODO

TODO:
* calculate losses by hand for bernoulli 
* figure out how to use infiltrator to debug Poisson EPCA
* figure out how to test poisson EPCA in a basic julia file (not just a notebook)


TODO:
* read about metaprogramming
* why <:A not a valid argument in a function?


SUGESTIONS for POMDPs.jl --> make a belief abstract type w/ discrete belief and continuous belief as subclasses
